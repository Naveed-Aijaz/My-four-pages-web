<!-- My Journey from Zero to HTML Hero -->
  <h2>My Journey from Zero to HTML Hero</h2>
  <br><br>
 <p>When I started learning web development, the very first step was HTML. It’s the skeleton of any website. In the beginning, I didn’t even know the difference between a <,div;>; and a <,span;>, but slowly I began to understand how to build structure. Semantic tags like <,header;>, <,footer;>, and <,section;> helped me create clean layouts. Now, I can confidently write a full webpage in HTML!</p>

  <h2>Essential HTML Tags Every Beginner Should Know</h2>
  <br><br>
  <p>In HTML, some tags are absolutely essential — like <'a'>, <'img'>, <'ul'>, <'table'>, and <'form'>. These elements bring life and functionality to a webpage. For example, <'form'> allows you to take user input, and <a''> helps with navigation. Once I studied these tags in detail, I realized that websites are not just about looks — they have real interactions built in.</p>

<h2>Stepping into the World of CSS</h2>

<p>After finishing HTML, I began learning CSS — and it felt like entering the world of design. Without CSS, a webpage is just plain text. My first tasks were changing colors and fonts. Then I started learning about spacing — margin, padding, and borders. Now, I’m learning how to control layouts and make my designs clean and modern.</p>

<h2>: Inline, Internal & External CSS – What’s the Difference?</h2>
<br><br>
 
  
<p>When writing CSS, there are three ways to apply it: inline, internal, and external. Inline CSS is written directly inside HTML tags, internal CSS goes inside a 'style' tag in the 'head', and external CSS is a separate .css file linked to the HTML. For bigger projects, external CSS is the best approach because it keeps everything organized and reusable.</p>

<p>When I learned about media queries in CSS, it opened a whole new level of design. Earlier, my webpage only looked good on a desktop, but it was broken on mobile. With media queries, I can now create different layouts for different screen sizes. Flexbox has also been super helpful in making my layouts responsive and flexible.</p>
